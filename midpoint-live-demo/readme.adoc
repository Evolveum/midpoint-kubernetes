Setup nfs on node:

[source,bash]
====
apt-get install nfs-common

cat << EOF >>/etc/systemd/resolved.conf
#[Resolve]
DNS=10.96.0.10
Domains=~cluster.local
EOF
====

[NOTE]
*nfs-common* is the name of the package on the debian based distribution (including ubuntu) with the necessary NFS mount support.
Once this package is available on the system the kubernetes can use nativly NFS in volume definition.

[NOTE]
To have resolvable cluster's FQDN it is needed to let the node's system know where is the DNS server located.
Without this information the node is resolving using external DNS servers which have no informationabout cluster's domain.
10.96.0.10 is IP address of cluster dns server. Your may be different.
